== EXTRA TOOLS USED BY DEVELOPERS ==
The following tools are used to generate source code in this project:
- dbus-binding-tool
- gob2
See the Makefile for how to generate the source code.


== EASY BUILD AND RUN ==
Use ./quick-build.sh to build the application and ./quick-run.sh to run it.


== DETAILLED BUILD STEPS ==
* Make a build directory
	mkdir BUILD && cd BUILD

* Use cmake to generate a Makefile
	cmake .. -DBUILD_PLUGIN_<plugin name>=ON
<plugin_name> is the name of the plugin you want, in capital letters. See the
CMakeLists.txt file for a complete list. You can also build the application
without plugins if you want.

* Build the source for real
	make

* Optional: install the application on your system
	make install
If you don't install the application, you may need to use environment variables
to tell the application where to look for data, configuration, machine and
plugin files.
You can use cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/prefix to choose a particular
install prefix.
